# JavaScript-Examples
Some micro projects builded using almost only javascript (and a bit of json), like a:

- button that toggles hello or goodbye when you press it

- counter with stored data 

- dropdown and a button that changes a font collor

- name form that sends what you've writed ..(as a alert for now cus I don't know backend yet)

- task form, that adds words to the page when you write on it. Small features like you cant send a empty form

- currency form that informs you what is the comparison between the currency that you've inserted and a dollar using json api to store the currencys and small features like the above one.
